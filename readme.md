# Do you know your F1 Drivers?

### Purpose and story behind building the game:

Do you know your F1 Drivers is a fun game to test your knowledge on the current F1 Drivers.  

I wanted to build this game as an F1 Fan from a very small age I have always had a passion for f1 and always loved
playing the games and thought I should build a game that tests everyones knowledge on their F1 Drivers.


### UX Strategy:

As the designer of this site the objective is to make this game fun and enjoyable for all users.  I want this game
to be pleasing on the eye and make it look as professional and as easy to use as I can.  The game should be easy
to work out and should be colourful with F1 colours like you would see on the TV.

### Who does this game Target:

This game targets anyone who is interested in F1 or just wants to learn about F1.  It allows people to have fun
as well as being able to guess the drivers face along side their names.  if you get the wrong answer the game will tell you
If you get all the names correct you will be in pole position.

### Expectation of the user:

1. The player should be able to find his way around the site without having any difficulty.
2. The game should be able to load relatively quickly and the user should have an enjoyable time with no bugs
or errors to slow him down.
3. The player will be able to see their position and also see how many F1 drivers they have left to pick from 
before they complete the game.
4. The player will be able to see the correct answer should he or she get the answer wrong on the first guess.
5.  Once the player has had a go the player will have the opportunity to go again by clicking on the go again button.

### Functionality

1. We will have a begin button to allow the player to start the game
2. This will be a simple one page site with easy navigation.  There will be a simple question about F1 and 
3.  The website will be colourful as I said above.  I want this site to be fun and colourful but at the same time keep it to the 
same theme as to what you would see on the TV.  This ensures for any F1 fans it looks like a proper F1 game.

### Things I left out

• I wanted to be able to add different levels and build more than just a few f1 drivers.  Possible add some MotoGp
drivers for level 2 and some F2 drivers for level 3 etc.  But at this stage of my course I didnt feel I was able to do
that yet.

### structure
The game will be suited to an audience of any age group.  It will have a clean UX keeping so all players of all ages can find there way around the site.
The game will have 1 page.  In the centre of the screen is where the game will be positioned with a question and 4 answers.

### Skeleton


• There will be a begin buttons  at the start of the game.
• once you start the game you will be able to go through the questions and try to complete them as best you can
The computer will inform you by highlighting the correct answer green if you get it wrong.
• There will be a small footer for the designers name.

### The Theme

The theme of this game will be F1 based the background image will be the main F1 logo and the colour theme around it 
will be as close to F1 colours as posible.  The font will be simple and plain for everyone to be able to read.

### Typography
The font used is Staatliches', cursive.  This is a very plain and simple text which is easy readable for everyone.

### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme as meantioned above will be very like the main F1 logo colour scheme.  This is making it look as close
to the real f1 experience for the F1 fans out there.
